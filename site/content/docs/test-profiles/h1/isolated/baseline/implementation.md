The primary throughput benchmark. Each connection sends one request at a time over persistent keep-alive connections.

**Connections:** 512, 4,096
**CPU limit:** 64 threads (container pinned to cores 0-31, 64-95 via `--cpuset-cpus`)

## Workload

A mix of three request types, rotated across connections:

- `GET /baseline11?a=13&b=42` - query parameter parsing, response: sum of values
- `POST /baseline11?a=13&b=42` with Content-Length body - query params + body parsing
- `POST /baseline11?a=13&b=42` with chunked Transfer-Encoding body - chunked decoding

This exercises the full HTTP handling path: request line parsing, header parsing, query string extraction, body reading (both Content-Length and chunked), integer arithmetic, and response serialization.

## Expected request/response

GET - sum of query parameters:

```
GET /baseline11?a=13&b=42 HTTP/1.1
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain

55
```

POST with body - sum of query parameters + body:

```
POST /baseline11?a=13&b=42 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 2

20
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain

75
```

## What it measures

- Raw request throughput under ideal conditions
- Full HTTP parsing pipeline performance
- Keep-alive connection handling efficiency
- How frameworks scale with increasing connection counts

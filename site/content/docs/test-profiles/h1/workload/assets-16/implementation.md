title: Implementation Guidelines
---
{{< type-rules production="Response compression must use the framework's standard middleware. Pre-compressed files on disk are allowed if the framework documents this as the official/recommended approach (e.g., ASP.NET MapStaticAssets, Nginx gzip_static). Binary formats (webp, woff2) should not be compressed." tuned="May cache compressed and uncompressed versions in memory. Pre-compressed files on disk allowed. Must serve uncompressed when Accept-Encoding: gzip is absent." engine="Pre-compressed files on disk allowed. Must respect Accept-Encoding header presence/absence. JSON endpoint must serialize and compress on every request — no pre-compressed JSON." >}}

The Assets-16 profile is identical to [Assets-4](../../assets-4/implementation) but with the server constrained to **16 CPUs and 32 GB memory** instead of 4 CPUs and 16 GB. This measures how well the framework scales asset serving with more available resources.

All [compression rules](../../assets-4/implementation/#compression-rules) and [caching rules](../../assets-4/implementation/#caching-rules) from Assets-4 apply.

## Docker constraints

The server container is started with:

```
--cpuset-cpus=0-7,64-71 --memory=32g --memory-swap=32g
```
